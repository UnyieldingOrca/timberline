# Timberline
AI-powered log analysis and actionable reporting

Timberline is a comprehensive log management and analysis platform designed to collect, process, and analyze logs from Kubernetes environments with AI-powered insights and actionable reporting.

## Overview

Timberline consists of several key components that work together to provide end-to-end log management:

- **Log Collector**: A high-performance Go-based DaemonSet that collects logs from Kubernetes containers
- **Log Ingestor**: Processes and stores incoming log data
- **Query Engine**: Enables fast querying and retrieval of log data
- **AI Analysis Engine**: Provides intelligent analysis and anomaly detection (implemented)
- **Reporting Service**: Generates actionable insights and reports
- **Web Dashboard**: User interface for visualization and management

## Components

### Log Collector

The Log Collector is a Go-based DaemonSet that runs on every Kubernetes node to collect container logs in real-time. It provides efficient log collection with Kubernetes metadata enrichment, configurable filtering, and secure forwarding to the log ingestion pipeline.

For detailed information about the Log Collector including configuration, deployment, monitoring, and development, see the [Log Collector README](log-collector/README.md).

**Key Features:**
- Real-time log tailing with pre-filtering
- Kubernetes metadata enrichment
- Buffering and batching for efficiency
- Prometheus metrics and health endpoints
- TLS support and secure communication

### AI Analysis Engine

The AI Analysis Engine is a Python-based service that performs intelligent log analysis using LLM-powered insights. It analyzes logs stored in the Milvus vector database to identify concerning patterns, rank severity, and generate actionable reports.

**Key Features:**
- Real-time log clustering and pattern detection
- LLM-based severity scoring and categorization
- Automated daily analysis reports
- Integration with local and cloud LLM providers
- Comprehensive health monitoring and metrics

For detailed information about the AI Analysis Engine, see the [AI Analyzer documentation](ai-analyzer/SPEC.md).

### Other Components

*Additional components (Log Ingestor, Query Engine, Reporting Service, etc.) will be documented as they are developed.*

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Kubernetes cluster (1.20+)
- kubectl configured
- Docker (for building images)

### Deployment

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/timberline/timberline.git
   cd timberline
   ```

2. **Deploy the log collector:**
   ```bash
   cd log-collector
   make deploy-all
   ```

3. **Verify deployment:**
   ```bash
   kubectl get pods -n timberline -l app=timberline-log-collector
   ```

# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Timberline is an AI-powered log analysis platform for Kubernetes environments consisting of multiple components:
- **Log Collector** (Go DaemonSet) - Currently implemented
- **Log Ingestor** (Go Service) - Currently implemented
- **Vector Database** (Milvus) - Integrated via Docker
- **AI Analysis Engine** (Python Service/Job) - Currently implemented
- **Web Dashboard** - Planned

## Architecture

The system follows a pipeline architecture where logs flow from Kubernetes pods → Log Collector → Log Ingestor → Vector Database → AI Analysis Engine. The Log Collector enriches logs with Kubernetes metadata and performs pre-filtering before forwarding to the ingestion pipeline.

## Development Commands

### Top-Level Commands
Use the top-level Makefile for Docker and integration testing:

```bash
make help             # Show all available commands
make docker-up        # Start Docker integration environment
make docker-down      # Stop Docker integration environment
make docker-test      # Start Docker services and run integration tests
make test-integration # Run Docker integration tests
make install-test-deps # Install Python test dependencies
```

### Component-Specific Commands
Each Go component (log-collector, log-ingestor) has identical Makefile targets:

```bash
cd log-collector    # or cd log-ingestor
make help           # Show available targets
make build          # Build binary
make test           # Run tests with race detection
make test-coverage  # Run tests with coverage report
make clean          # Clean build artifacts
make deps           # Download and tidy dependencies
make fmt            # Format Go code
make lint           # Run golangci-lint
make run            # Build and run locally
make docker-build   # Build Docker image
make docker-push    # Build and push Docker image
make dev            # Quick dev cycle: fmt + lint + test + build
```

## Key Technologies

- **Go 1.23+** with modules for log collector and log ingestor
- **Kubernetes client-go** for cluster integration
- **Prometheus client** for metrics
- **Milvus** vector database for embedding storage
- **Docker Compose** for development environment
- **Python/pytest** for integration testing

## Configuration

The Log Collector uses environment variables for configuration:
- `LOG_PATHS`, `LOG_LEVELS`, `BUFFER_SIZE`, `FLUSH_INTERVAL`
- `INGESTOR_URL`, `BATCH_SIZE`, `RETRY_ATTEMPTS`
- `METRICS_PORT` for Prometheus endpoint

## Testing and Validation

### Unit Tests
Run unit tests for each component:
```bash
cd log-collector && make test    # Test log collector
cd log-ingestor && make test     # Test log ingestor
```

### Integration Tests
Comprehensive Docker-based integration tests for the complete pipeline:

```bash
# Start Docker environment and run integration tests
make docker-test

# Run integration tests (Docker must be running)
make test-integration

# Start/stop Docker environment manually
make docker-up
make docker-down

# Install Python test dependencies
make install-test-deps

# Manual test execution
./scripts/run-integration-tests.sh --parallel

# Run specific test classes
pytest tests/docker/test_integration.py::TestLogIngestor -v -m docker
pytest tests/docker/test_integration.py::TestDataPersistence -v -m docker

# Run only pipeline tests (slow)
pytest tests/docker/test_integration.py -v -m "docker and slow"
```

The integration tests cover:
- Service health checks (log-collector, log-ingestor, Milvus, llama.cpp, etcd, MinIO)
- Log ingestion API endpoints
- Complete pipeline data flow from files → collector → ingestor → Milvus
- Embedding generation and semantic search
- Data persistence verification
- Metrics collection endpoints
- AI analysis engine integration and log clustering
- LLM-based severity scoring and report generation

The collector includes comprehensive metrics and health endpoints for monitoring in production.
